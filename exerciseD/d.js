//Create a bookmarking app where you can save URLs. It should have a form where you enter the URL, a title, and a "tag". There should be a list of all the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags (this should be generated dynamically from the link collection). When you click on a tag, the link list should show only those tags. Hint: which tag is selected is "application state".
